# Beam-Sheer-Analysis
This program produces sheer diagram of a beam when fed loads and reactions. The matplotlib library must be installed for the sheer diagtram to be produced properly. 
The results are reported in newtons and meters, assuming the user inputs their data in the same units. I plan on adding features in the future including, but not limited to: 
A function to solve for reactions, a function that produces a bending moment diagram, and a function that solves for maximum normal and sheer stress.
